"War of Rain-Hans"

# Project Title

My first ever game I coded.

## Author

*Martti Laanesaar*

I coded the game with the help of my teacher.

## Description

The game is actually really easy and simplified because this is the first game I have ever coded.\
The aim of the game is to kill all the Rain-Hanses with the good old space ship. The space ship can shoot as much bullets as your soul craves for. You have a total of 3 lives that you can use until you basically die, after you die, you have an option to start again from the beginning by pressing the "PLAY" button. 
Every time you kill one of the moving Rain-Hanses you get 50 points, which allows you to keep track of how many Rain-Hanses you have killed. If you are such a pro and dont die, then you can basically play the game forever. But keep in mind that the game gets more difficult the more you play it, meaning that Rain-Hanses get faster, so be ready!

## Getting Started

Once you boot up the game for the first time, you kinda need to hit the play button. After that the Rain-Hanses will start to move from left to right.

### Dependencies

You will indeed have to import a plugin called pygame if you are using pycharm for example.\
You may use any OS that supports python codes.

### Installing

At the moment I believe the best way to play this game is to download it and then use a program called PyCharm, or anything that is similar to the program. Once you download both the program and the game, then you should be able to unzip and insert the files of the game into the program. And before you launch the game you will need to import a plugin called pygame. (*import pygame*)
